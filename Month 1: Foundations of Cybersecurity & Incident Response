Here’s a detailed breakdown for Month 1 (Weeks 1–4): concepts, hands-on lab exercises, notes & GitHub ideas, and suggested platforms you can use. You can treat this as a mini-project for your Blue-Team portfolio.

I’ll also point to relevant PDFs, GitHub repos with notes/writeups, and lab platforms (TryHackMe, etc.).

Month 1 (Weeks 1–4): Foundations of Cybersecurity & Incident Response
🎯 Objectives

By end of Month 1, you should be comfortable with:

Key security & IR concepts (kill chain, MITRE ATT&CK, incident flow)

Basics of threat intelligence (TTPs, IOCs/IOAs)

Reading and interpreting logs (Windows, Sysmon, Linux)

Understanding basic network traffic (TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP/S)

Having a working lab setup (Windows + Linux + log collection + SIEM/monitoring)

📘 Concepts & Theory to Cover (Week-wise)
Week	Topics & Concepts
Week 1	Cyber Kill Chain, MITRE ATT&CK, Pyramid of Pain
– Understand each stage of the kill chain (Recon, Weaponization, Delivery, Exploitation, Installation, C2, Actions on Objectives).
– MITRE ATT&CK: tactics, techniques, sub-techniques, mapping adversary behavior.
– Pyramid of Pain: which IOCs adversaries care about, and how defenders should prioritize detection.
Week 2	Incident Response Lifecycle
– Preparation, Detection & Analysis, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, Lessons Learned.
– What your role is in each phase; coordinating with teams; logging, playbooks, escalation paths.
Week 3	Threat Intelligence Basics
– TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures), IOCs (Indicators of Compromise), IOAs (Indicators of Attack).
– Threat intelligence lifecycle (collection, processing, analysis, dissemination).
– CTI standards (e.g. STIX/TAXII).
Week 4	Log & Network Fundamentals (theory refresher and deeper dive)
– Windows Event Logs, Sysmon events, Linux syslog / journald / auth logs.
– Network stack: OSI vs TCP/IP models; how DNS works; HTTP/HTTPS basics; packets, flows, ports, TCP handshake, etc.
– How logs and network data relate (e.g. flow records, packet captures).
🧪 Hands-on / Lab Exercises

Below is a suggested lab plan for each week. You can use a local virtualization environment (VirtualBox, VMware) or cloud lab (AWS, Azure, GCP) if you prefer.

Week	Lab Tasks / Platform Ideas
Week 1	1. Set up your lab:
 • Create two VMs: one Windows (e.g. Windows 10) and one Linux (e.g. Ubuntu).
 • Add a “monitoring node” VM (Ubuntu) to host SIEM / log aggregator / network sniffer.
2. On Windows VM, enable basic Windows Event Logs, install Sysinternals tools (Process Explorer, Autoruns, TCPView, etc.).
3. On Linux VM, generate logs (e.g. via sudo apt update, logins, etc.), inspect /var/log.
4. (Optional) Deploy Security Onion or ElastAlert in your monitoring VM to receive logs.
Week 2	1. Install Sysmon (on Windows VM). Configure a basic Sysmon config (process creation, network connection events).
2. Trigger a few benign actions: run applications, open browser, connect to web, etc. Observe which Sysmon events appear.
3. Forward Windows logs (EventLog + Sysmon) to your monitoring VM (via NXLog, Winlogbeat, or equivalent).
4. On monitoring VM, ingest logs into a simple open-source SIEM or log aggregator (e.g. ELK stack, Graylog).
Week 3	1. Explore a TryHackMe “Threat Intelligence / CTI” room (e.g. “Intro to Cyber Threat Intel”). 
Medium

2. Collect IOCs from free feeds (e.g. AlienVault OTX, MalwareBazaar), save them.
3. Attempt to detect those IOCs in your logs (if your lab is generating relevant data).
4. Write a mini threat intel report: topic, collected IOCs, what TTPs they map to.
Week 4	1. Use tcpdump or Wireshark on your monitoring VM to capture packets between VMs.
2. Generate simple DNS/HTTP traffic (browse some websites) and analyze packet captures.
3. Correlate a network flow to a log event (e.g. Windows VM makes an HTTP request; see it in logs + packet capture).
4. Document sample network flow → source IP / dest IP / port / protocol, and link it to system logs.

🗂️ Sample GitHub Notes & Portfolio Setup (for Month 1)

While you work through Month 1, you can keep a GitHub repo for your “Foundations” section. Here’s a sample structure:

month1-foundations/

In notes/ you summarize the theory in your own words (with diagrams).

In lab_exercises/ store configs, data captures, your analyses, observations, and explanations.

In README.md, mention how to navigate the repo, what labs you’ve done, what you learned.

Over time, this becomes part of your Blue Team Portfolio.
