# Month 1 (Weeks 1‚Äì4): Foundations of Cybersecurity & Incident Response

## üéØ Objectives

By the end of Month 1, you should be comfortable with:

- Key security & IR concepts (kill chain, MITRE ATT&CK, incident flow)
- Basics of threat intelligence (TTPs, IOCs/IOAs)
- Reading and interpreting logs (Windows, Sysmon, Linux)
- Understanding basic network traffic (TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP/S)
- Having a working lab setup (Windows + Linux + log collection + SIEM/monitoring)

---

## üìò Concepts & Theory to Cover (Week-wise)

| Week   | Topics & Concepts |
|--------|------------------|
| **Week 1** | **Cyber Kill Chain, MITRE ATT&CK, Pyramid of Pain**<br>- Understand each stage of the kill chain (Recon, Weaponization, Delivery, Exploitation, Installation, C2, Actions on Objectives).<br>- MITRE ATT&CK: tactics, techniques, sub-techniques, mapping adversary behavior.<br>- Pyramid of Pain: which IOCs adversaries care about, and how defenders should prioritize detection. |
| **Week 2** | **Incident Response Lifecycle**<br>- Preparation, Detection & Analysis, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, Lessons Learned.<br>- What your role is in each phase; coordinating with teams; logging, playbooks, escalation paths. |
| **Week 3** | **Threat Intelligence Basics**<br>- TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures), IOCs (Indicators of Compromise), IOAs (Indicators of Attack).<br>- Threat intelligence lifecycle (collection, processing, analysis, dissemination).<br>- CTI standards (e.g. STIX/TAXII). |
| **Week 4** | **Log & Network Fundamentals (theory refresher and deeper dive)**<br>- Windows Event Logs, Sysmon events, Linux syslog / journald / auth logs.<br>- Network stack: OSI vs TCP/IP models; how DNS works; HTTP/HTTPS basics; packets, flows, ports, TCP handshake, etc.<br>- How logs and network data relate (e.g. flow records, packet captures). |

## üß™ Hands-on / Lab Exercises

Below is a suggested lab plan for each week. You can use a local virtualization environment (VirtualBox, VMware) or cloud lab (AWS, Azure, GCP) if you prefer.

| Week   | Lab Tasks / Platform Ideas |
|--------|---------------------------|
| **Week 1** | 1. Set up your lab:<br>‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Create two VMs: one Windows (e.g. Windows 10) and one Linux (e.g. Ubuntu).<br>‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Add a ‚Äúmonitoring node‚Äù VM (Ubuntu) to host SIEM / log aggregator / network sniffer.<br>2. On Windows VM, enable basic Windows Event Logs, install Sysinternals tools (Process Explorer, Autoruns, TCPView, etc.).<br>3. On Linux VM, generate logs (e.g. via `sudo apt update`, logins, etc.), inspect `/var/log`.<br>4. (Optional) Deploy Security Onion or ElastAlert in your monitoring VM to receive logs. |
| **Week 2** | 1. Install Sysmon (on Windows VM). Configure a basic Sysmon config (process creation, network connection events).<br>2. Trigger a few benign actions: run applications, open browser, connect to web, etc. Observe which Sysmon events appear.<br>3. Forward Windows logs (EventLog + Sysmon) to your monitoring VM (via NXLog, Winlogbeat, or equivalent).<br>4. On monitoring VM, ingest logs into a simple open-source SIEM or log aggregator (e.g. ELK stack, Graylog). |
| **Week 3** | 1. Explore a TryHackMe ‚ÄúThreat Intelligence / CTI‚Äù room (e.g. ‚ÄúIntro to Cyber Threat Intel‚Äù).<br>2. Collect IOCs from free feeds (e.g. AlienVault OTX, MalwareBazaar), save them.<br>3. Attempt to detect those IOCs in your logs (if your lab is generating relevant data).<br>4. Write a mini threat intel report: topic, collected IOCs, what TTPs they map to. |
| **Week 4** | 1. Use tcpdump or Wireshark on your monitoring VM to capture packets between VMs.<br>2. Generate simple DNS/HTTP traffic (browse some websites) and analyze packet captures.<br>3. Correlate a network flow to a log event (e.g. Windows VM makes an HTTP request; see it in logs + packet capture).<br>4. Document sample network flow ‚Üí source IP / dest IP / port / protocol, and link it to system logs. |
