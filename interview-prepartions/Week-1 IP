1. Key Security & IR Concepts
Common Interview Questions
Question	Answer / Explanation
What is the cyber kill chain?	A model describing stages of a cyberattack: Reconnaissance → Weaponization → Delivery → Exploitation → Installation → Command & Control (C2) → Actions on Objectives. Helps defenders detect and stop attacks at each stage.
Explain MITRE ATT&CK.	A knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques. ATT&CK maps real-world attack techniques to detection and mitigation strategies.
What are the phases of an incident response (IR) lifecycle?	1. Preparation
2. Identification
3. Containment
4. Eradication
5. Recovery
6. Lessons Learned
What is the difference between an IOC and an IOA?	IOC (Indicator of Compromise): Evidence of a past attack (IP, hash, domain).
IOA (Indicator of Attack): Evidence of an attack in progress (suspicious process behavior, lateral movement).
How do you measure SOC/IR effectiveness?	Metrics: MTTD (Mean Time to Detect), MTTR (Mean Time to Respond), false positives, incident counts.
Lab / Practical

Goal: Map a simple simulated attack to the Kill Chain and MITRE ATT&CK.

Steps:

Setup Lab: Windows 10 VM + Kali Linux VM + SIEM (e.g., Wazuh or Splunk Free Trial).

Simulate Attack: Use metasploit to run a controlled exploit against Windows VM.

Log Collection: Collect Windows Event logs, Sysmon logs, and network traffic.

Analysis: Map observed behavior to Kill Chain stages and MITRE ATT&CK tactics.

Screenshot Example:

Sysmon detecting ProcessCreate of powershell.exe

Network logs showing DNS queries to suspicious domain

Diagram:

Recon → Weaponization → Delivery → Exploitation → Installation → C2 → Actions
  |       |               |             |             |        |
  Log1    Log2           Log3          Log4          Net1     Alert1

2. Threat Intelligence (TTPs, IOCs/IOAs)
Common Interview Questions
Question	Answer
What are TTPs?	Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures used by attackers. Tactics = goal, Techniques = method, Procedures = step-by-step.
How do you gather threat intelligence?	OSINT (Open Source), CTI feeds, honeypots, SIEM alerts, MITRE ATT&CK mapping.
How is threat intelligence applied in SOC?	Prioritize alerts, block malicious IPs, detect patterns in logs, create custom detection rules.
Lab / Practical

Goal: Detect IOCs/IOAs in a lab environment.

Steps:

Configure Windows Event logging + Sysmon.

Create simulated IOC: malicious hash, suspicious IP.

Use Splunk/Wazuh to query logs for matches.

Example Query (Splunk):

index=windows sourcetype=Sysmon EventCode=1 Hashes="*malware_hash*"


Screenshot: Splunk showing IOC match with time, user, and host.

3. Reading & Interpreting Logs (Windows, Sysmon, Linux)
Common Interview Questions
Question	Answer
How do you detect suspicious activity in Windows logs?	Look for unexpected logon times, new processes, failed logons, privilege escalation events.
What are the key Sysmon events to monitor?	ProcessCreate (1), NetworkConnect (3), FileCreate (11), RegistryEvent (13).
How do you analyze Linux logs?	/var/log/auth.log, /var/log/syslog, journalctl for system/service logs.
Lab / Practical

Goal: Detect suspicious login and process activity.

Steps:

Generate normal activity + suspicious activity (e.g., nc reverse shell).

Analyze Windows Event Logs (Event Viewer) and Linux logs (/var/log).

Highlight anomalies like unusual process execution, failed logons, privilege escalation.

Screenshot Example:

Windows Event Viewer showing EventID 4625 (failed logon)

Linux auth.log showing sudo execution by non-admin user

Diagram:

User Login → Log Event → SIEM Alert → Analyst Review → Response

4. Understanding Basic Network Traffic (TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP/S)
Common Interview Questions
Question	Answer
How do you detect suspicious network traffic?	Unusual ports, external IPs, abnormal traffic volume, failed connections.
Difference between TCP and UDP?	TCP: Connection-oriented, reliable.
UDP: Connectionless, faster, unreliable.
How is DNS abused by attackers?	Domain generation algorithms (DGA), data exfiltration, C2 communication.
How to monitor HTTP/S traffic?	Use Wireshark, Zeek, or SIEM network logs.
Lab / Practical

Goal: Capture and analyze network traffic.

Steps:

Setup Wireshark on Kali Linux or Windows.

Simulate traffic: normal web browsing + controlled malicious traffic.

Analyze TCP sessions, HTTP headers, DNS queries for anomalies.

Screenshot Example:

Wireshark showing suspicious HTTP POST to external IP

DNS query logs showing repeated failed resolutions

Diagram:

[Internal VM] → TCP/HTTP → [External IP] → SIEM logs → Analyst detection

5. Working Lab Setup

Requirements:

Windows VM: For endpoint logs and simulated attacks

Linux VM: For attacks, monitoring, and Sysmon forwarding

SIEM: Wazuh, Splunk, or ELK stack

Log collection: Sysmon, auditd, Windows Event Logs

Network monitoring: Wireshark or Zeek

Diagram:

Windows VM ──┐
             │──> Log Forwarder ──> SIEM ──> Dashboard / Alerts
Linux VM ────┘


Lab Practical Tasks for Interview:

Collect logs using Sysmon / auditd

Forward logs to SIEM

Detect a simulated malware execution or suspicious network traffic

Map findings to MITRE ATT&CK and Kill Chain

Document screenshots and response steps

✅ Tips for Interview Readiness

Prepare screenshots of your lab: process execution, SIEM alerts, network capture.

Be ready to explain your reasoning: "Why I flagged this IP as malicious", "How this map to Kill Chain".

Know basic commands: eventvwr, Get-EventLog, journalctl, tcpdump, netstat.

Prepare one diagram per lab scenario to explain flow visually.
