1. Key Security & IR Concepts
Common Interview Questions (with concise answers)
Cyber Kill Chain:
Describes the stages of a cyberattack (Recon → Weaponization → Delivery → Exploitation → Installation → C2 → Actions on Objectives). Defenders can disrupt attacks at each stage.
MITRE ATT&CK:
A knowledge base mapping real-world adversary tactics/techniques to detection/mitigation.
IR Lifecycle Phases:
Preparation
Identification
Containment
Eradication
Recovery
Lessons Learned
IOC vs IOA:
IOC: Evidence of past attack (IP, hash, domain).
IOA: Evidence of ongoing attack (e.g., suspicious process, lateral movement).
Measuring SOC/IR:
Metrics: MTTD, MTTR, false positives, incident counts.
Lab Exercise
Goal: Map simulated attack to Kill Chain & MITRE ATT&CK.
Steps:
Setup: Windows 10 VM + Kali Linux VM + SIEM (Wazuh/Splunk).
Simulate attack (e.g., Metasploit exploit on Windows).
Collect logs: Windows Events, Sysmon, network traffic.
Analyze logs: Map to Kill Chain & MITRE ATT&CK.
Capture screenshots of detections.
Sample Diagram
Code
Recon → Weaponization → Delivery → Exploitation → Installation → C2 → Actions
  |         |             |            |            |         |
  [Log1]  [Log2]       [Log3]       [Log4]       [Net1]   [Alert1]
2. Threat Intelligence (TTPs, IOCs/IOAs)
Common Interview Questions
TTPs: Tactics (goal), Techniques (method), Procedures (steps).
Gathering Threat Intel: OSINT, CTI feeds, honeypots, SIEM, MITRE mapping.
SOC Use: Prioritize alerts, block IOCs, detect patterns, custom rules.
Lab Exercise
Goal: Detect IOCs/IOAs in logs.
Steps:
Configure Windows logging + Sysmon.
Generate simulated IOC (malicious hash/IP).
Query logs in SIEM for matches.
Sample Splunk Query
Code
index=windows sourcetype=Sysmon EventCode=1 Hashes="*malware_hash*"
3. Reading & Interpreting Logs
Common Interview Questions
Suspicious Windows Activity: Unexpected logons, new/odd processes, failed logons, privilege escalations.
Key Sysmon Events: ProcessCreate (1), NetworkConnect (3), FileCreate (11), RegistryEvent (13).
Linux Log Analysis:
/var/log/auth.log
/var/log/syslog
journalctl
Lab Exercise
Goal: Detect suspicious logins/processes.
Steps:
Generate activity (normal + malicious).
Analyze logs (Windows Event Viewer, Linux CLI).
Highlight anomalies.
Sample Diagram
Code
User Login → Log Event → SIEM Alert → Analyst Review → Response
4. Understanding Basic Network Traffic
Common Interview Questions
Detecting Suspicious Traffic: Unusual ports, external IPs, high volume, failed connects.
TCP vs UDP:
TCP: Reliable, connection-oriented.
UDP: Fast, connectionless, unreliable.
DNS Abuse: DGA, exfiltration, C2.
HTTP/S Monitoring: Wireshark, Zeek, SIEM.
Lab Exercise
Goal: Capture/analyze traffic.
Steps:
Use Wireshark.
Simulate normal + malicious traffic.
Analyze sessions, headers, DNS queries.
Sample Diagram
Code
[Internal VM] → TCP/HTTP → [External IP] → SIEM Logs → Analyst Detection
5. Working Lab Setup
Requirements
Windows VM (endpoint logs, attacks)
Linux VM (attack simulation, monitoring)
SIEM (Wazuh, Splunk, ELK)
Log Collection (Sysmon, auditd, Windows logs)
Network Monitoring (Wireshark, Zeek)
Sample Diagram
Code
Windows VM ──┐
             │──> Log Forwarder ──> SIEM ──> Dashboard / Alerts
Linux VM ────┘
Lab Practical Tasks for Interview
Collect logs (Sysmon/auditd)
Forward logs to SIEM
Detect simulated malware or network anomalies
Map to MITRE ATT&CK/Kill Chain
Document with screenshots & response steps
Interview Readiness Tips
Prepare annotated screenshots (SIEM, process execution, network captures)
Be ready to explain reasoning and mapping to frameworks
Practice key commands:
Windows: eventvwr, Get-EventLog
Linux: journalctl, tcpdump, netstat
Prepare diagrams for each scenario
