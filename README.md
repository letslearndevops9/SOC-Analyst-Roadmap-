# 🛡️ 6-Month Incident Responder & Threat Hunter Learning Path

Welcome! This self-paced, hands-on roadmap will help you transition from beginner to job-ready in cybersecurity incident response and threat hunting. It is designed to build both your theoretical foundations and practical skills with a strong emphasis on labs, detection engineering, and real-world cases.

---

## 📅 Month 1: Foundations of Cybersecurity & Incident Response

### Concepts
- **Cyber kill chain**, **MITRE ATT&CK**, **Pyramid of Pain**
- Incident response lifecycle:  
  `Preparation → Detection → Containment → Eradication → Recovery → Lessons Learned`
- Threat intelligence basics: TTPs, IOCs, IOAs

### Skills
- Log analysis fundamentals (Windows Event Logs, Sysmon, Linux logs)
- Network traffic basics (TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP/S)

### Hands-on
- Build a lab (VMs: Windows, Linux, SIEM like Splunk/ELK/Graylog, Sysmon)
- Install and practice with Sysinternals tools

### Resources
- Book: *The Practice of Network Security Monitoring* (Richard Bejtlich)
- [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/)
- TryHackMe: *Intro to Cyber Defense* path

---

## 📅 Month 2: SIEM, EDR, and Detection Engineering

### Concepts
- What is **SIEM**, **SOAR**, and **EDR**
- Rule creation & tuning
- Detection methodologies (signature-based vs behavioral)

### Skills
- Splunk/ELK queries (search, alerts, dashboards)
- EDR tools (CrowdStrike Falcon, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Velociraptor)
- Correlation & threat hunting queries

### Hands-on
- Use Splunk free edition or ELK to analyze logs
- Write correlation rules for brute force, lateral movement, persistence

### Resources
- Splunk Boss of the SOC (BOTS) CTF labs
- Blue Team Labs Online / CyberDefenders challenges
- TryHackMe: *SOC Level 1* path

---

## 📅 Month 3: Threat Hunting Methodologies

### Concepts
- Hypothesis-driven threat hunting
- Hunting with MITRE ATT&CK mapping
- Use cases: phishing, ransomware, privilege escalation

### Skills
- Building hunting playbooks
- Memory analysis (Volatility, Redline)
- PCAP analysis (Wireshark, Zeek)

### Hands-on
- Capture live attack traffic in your lab
- Hunt for persistence mechanisms in Windows registry
- Use Volatility to extract IOCs from memory dumps

### Resources
- [Threat Hunting Project](https://threathunting.net/)
- Book: *Practical Threat Hunting* (S. Lee)

---

## 📅 Month 4: Incident Response in Action

### Concepts
- Digital forensics basics
- Containment strategies (network isolation, account disablement)
- Eradication & recovery (reimaging, patching)
- Reporting & documentation

### Skills
- Live response data collection
- Incident report writing
- Case management

### Hands-on
- IR simulation (respond to simulated ransomware)
- Analyze phishing email headers and attachments
- Practice chain-of-custody documentation

### Resources
- SANS IR case studies (FREE PDFs)
- TryHackMe: *Blue Primer* & *Phishing Analysis* rooms

---

## 📅 Month 5: Advanced Threat Hunting & Automation

### Concepts
- Threat intel feeds & enrichment (MISP, OpenCTI, AlienVault OTX)
- Advanced hunting with YARA, Sigma rules
- Automation with Python & PowerShell

### Skills
- Write YARA rules to detect malware
- Build Sigma rules for SIEM
- Automate log parsing with Python

### Hands-on
- Create your own Sigma-to-Splunk pipeline
- Enrich IOCs with VirusTotal & OTX APIs
- Script IOC extraction from logs

### Resources
- [Sigma HQ GitHub](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma)
- Florian Roth’s YARA rule sets
- Book: *Blue Team Handbook: SOC, SIEM, and Threat Hunting*

---

## 📅 Month 6: Simulations, Red-Blue, and Certifications

### Concepts
- Purple teaming basics (how attackers think vs defenders react)
- Real-world APT case studies
- Measuring SOC/IR effectiveness (MTTD, MTTR)

### Skills
- Participate in CTFs (Blue Team, SOC challenges)
- Conduct end-to-end IR exercise in lab
- Build portfolio (document hunts, incident reports, detection rules)

### Hands-on
- Run Red Team tools (Caldera, Atomic Red Team) against your lab
- Simulate incident → detect → respond → report

### Certifications to Consider
- **Beginner**: CompTIA Security+ or Blue Team Level 1 (BTL1)
- **Intermediate**: GIAC GCFA (Forensics), GCIA (Intrusion Analysis), or GCTI (Threat Hunter)
- **Budget-friendly**: TryHackMe SOC Level 2, CyberDefenders labs

---

## 🗂️ Weekly Time Split (10–12 hrs/week)

- **40%** → Theory & Reading
- **40%** → Labs & Hands-on
- **20%** → Notes, reporting, and writing playbooks

---

## ✅ After 6 months, you’ll be able to:

- Work as SOC Analyst (Tier 2/3), Incident Responder, or Threat Hunter
- Build hunting playbooks, write detection rules, and handle incidents end-to-end
- Show hands-on experience via labs, GitHub portfolio, and case writeups
